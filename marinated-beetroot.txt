# Ingredients

- 6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp thyme leaves
- 4 raw beetroot, peeled and very thinly sliced on a mandoline or with a food processor slicing attachment
- 2 x 100g vegetarian goat's cheese rounds with rind, halved horizontally
- 4 handfuls rocket

# Directions

Mix the oil, vinegar, sugar and thyme in a shallow dish and season well.
Add the sliced beetroot and marinate for at least 1 hr or overnight, if you like.

Heat grill to high.
Season the goat’s cheese slices, then place on an oiled baking tray and grill for 2-3 mins until golden and melting.

Lift out the beetroot, reserving the marinade, and divide between 4 plates.
Top with the rocket, a round of goat’s cheese and a little more rocket.
Drizzle with the marinade and serve.
