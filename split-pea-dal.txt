# Ingredients

- 1 cup yellow split peas (uncooked)
- 2 cups water (or vegetable broth)
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp cayenne
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tablespoon margarine
- 1 onion (diced)
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin (whole seeds or ground)
- 2 whole cloves

# Directions

In a large pot, place the uncooked yellow split peas and the water or vegetable broth, and bring to a slow simmer.

Add the turmeric, cayenne, and salt, and cover.

Cook for at least 20 minutes, covered, until the yellow split peas are fully cooked, stirring occasionally.

You can also continue to cook your dal for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, if you prefer, to allow the yellow split peas to break up and have a smoother texture. 

Either way, once the split peas are almost done, in a separate large skillet or frying pan, heat the onion, cumin, and clove in the margarine.
Cook for 4 to 6 minutes, until onion, is soft (if you happen to have some asafoetida hing spice on hand you can also add a little in for about 30 seconds just for extra flavor).

Add the onion and spices mixture to the split peas, and allow to simmer for at least 5 more minutes.

Add a dash of pepper and more salt, if desired, and serve hot with rice or alone in a soup bowl.
